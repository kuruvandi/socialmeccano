CHANGELOG

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GROUP AND CHAT

+ When groups are destroyed, all users are removed from the chat channels 
    and the channel is destroyed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

!CRITICAL FIX! : Fixed grave security oversight from previous hack where users could 
                 login to channels they didn't have permission for.

Chat:
+ Managed to generate a list of users via the qa_users table (still early days)
+ Created two Databases:
    + Database ajax_chat_channels to store ChannelIDs and ChannelNames
    + Database ajax_chat_users to store userIDs, userNames and ChannelIDs (non-indexed, non-primary)
+ Modified install script to support adding 'base' data to these databases.
+ Userlist is NOW generated using the new ajax_chat_users database
+ ChannelList is NOW generated using the new ajax_chat_channels database
+ Converted all static PHP file reading into Database reading
+ Fancybox no longer has close option (was causing a boatload of issues with socket)

Groups:
+ Cosmetic Changes to buttons on sidepanel
+ Added group chat
+ Newly Created Groups Now:
    !+ Create a new chat channel using group name (maybe needs to be more secure?)
